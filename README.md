This repository is meant for my Java code. It will include reference code samples, some exploration code, and projects that are not tied to some planned release.

##Jobs

This is the code I wrote as I worked my way through the problems in "Cracking the Coding Interview", by Gayle Laakmann.

##_Trinity

Repository of useful code references and examples. The 'effective' project is specifically examples from "Effective Java" that I want a quick reference to.

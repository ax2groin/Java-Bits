# Java Bits

This repository is meant for my Java code. It will include reference code
samples, some exploration code, and projects that are not tied to some planned
release.

## Jobs

This is the code I wrote as I worked my way through the problems in "Cracking
the Coding Interview", by Gayle Laakmann.

## _Trinity

Repository of useful code references and examples. The 'effective' project is
specifically examples from "Effective Java" that I want a quick reference to.

## Exercism

Repository of answer to Java problems from
[Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/java/about)
